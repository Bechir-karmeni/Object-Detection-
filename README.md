> Object detection and tracking is one of the areas of computer vision that is maturing very rapidly. It allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. With this kind of identification and localization, object detection and tracking can be used to count objects in a particular scene and determine and track their precise locations, all while accurately labeling them.
In this project, i have made use of two of the most popular Python libraries for object detection, OpenCV and ImageAI.
